   - make a matrix multiply wrapper
     There can be two kinds of wrappers. One wrapper can take a hard-coded
     set of weights and hard-wire those weights into the module? Maybe talk more
     about this at the next meeting. I am confused how we can use hard-wired weights
     when we will need to be changing the weights during training.

   - OK. We will have 3? possible types of noise source choices. We have weights, input_features,
     and the select streams. I guess we will have choices for each available through arguments
     to the script.

   - I need to really think about my 'API' Im building.
     What kind of stuff do I really want my code to do?
         First off, I want a matrix multiply module to be generated which is
         ready to run on an FPGA.

         Secondly, I want users to be able to generate stochastic modules and
         stochastic buidling blocks easily by using my python 'library'.

         Thirdly, I want to be able to run my modules in simulation using Vincent's
         py-sc repository. I can use rng stochastic sequences and run them through
         my modules and determine the performance and accuracy of my stochastic modules.
