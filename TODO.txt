- Re-verify that all the testbenches work at this point
- make a matrix multiply module wrapper that could actually run on the FPGA
- make a stochastic dot product simulation module, one with SNGs and convertors
- how to seed LFSRs? There is definitely a wrong way to seed them.

- maybe think about a paper/report to right.
