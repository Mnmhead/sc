- Re-verify that all the testbenches work at this point
- make a matrix multiply module wrapper that could actually run on the FPGA
- make a stochastic dot product simulation module, one with SNGs and convertors
- change lfsr code, use armin's code instead. This requires going on the downstairs lab machine and
      generating a file to see what the heck it looks like. Then add random-seeding options
      to the verilog LFSRs



- maybe think about a paper/report to right.
