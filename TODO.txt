   -  make sure dot_product test bench actually works. (The reading 1 bit thing might be an issue)
      eventually add in the bipolar flag (generate correct vectors for bipolar)
      ADD a valid output to sc_dot_prod

   - generate a matrix multiply testbench in the same way

   - figure out how to generate select streams (LFSR stuff needs figuring out)
     counter is the easiest way. (Vander corpit is wild, look up what that is)

   - think about how the matrix multiply wrapper is going to work.
      I can understand the binary->stochastic portion (weight and input stream generation)
      How to I make the back-end, meaning, how do I make stochastic->binary conversion.

   - make a matrix multiply wrapper (after I fukin figure out how)

   - make a bipolar multiply testbench.
   
   - make an alahgi adder testbench. 
   
   - make an alaghi adder tree that adds n inputs, where n is any natural number.

   - add support for alahgi adder
