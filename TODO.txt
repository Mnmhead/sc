- make a stochastic dot product simulation generation script
- make a matrix multiply module wrapper that could actually run on the FPGA

- Add alaghi_adder tree to arithmetic.py in Vincent's project? Yeah I think I will.

- ok so I saw some weird stuff with the alaghi adder and the reset signal today.
   If the reset signal is high and the starting input causes xor_input to be high, then
   the tff will change values immediately when rst is de-asserted instead of 1 cycle later like we want.
   Ask Vincent about this.

- maybe think about a paper/report to right.
