- verify that dot_product with alaghi adder works
- verify that matrix multiply with alaghi adder works
- make a matrix multiply module wrapper that could actually run on the FPGA
- make a stochastic dot product simulation module, one with SNGs and convertors
- how to seed LFSRs? There is definitely a wrong way to seed them.

- ok so I saw some weird stuff with the alaghi adder and the reset signal today.
   If the reset signal is high and the starting input causes xor_input to be high, then
   the tff will change values immediately when rst is de-asserted instead of 1 cycle later like we want.
   Ask Vincent about this.

- maybe think about a paper/report to right.
