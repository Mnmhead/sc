   - generate a matrix multiply testbench 

   - in the testbenches when i instantiate the DUT modules I might not be using the right module names.
     fuckkkkk

   - go back and change the TEST_SIZE stuff in dot_product testbench

   - figure out how to generate select streams (LFSR stuff needs figuring out)
     counter is the easiest way. (Vander corpit is wild, look up what that is)

   - think about how the matrix multiply wrapper is going to work.
      I can understand the binary->stochastic portion (weight and input stream generation)
      How to I make the back-end, meaning, how do I make stochastic->binary conversion.

      OK. We will have 3? possible types of noise source choices. We have weights, input_features,
      and the select streams. I guess we will have choices for each available through arguments
      to the script.

   - make a matrix multiply wrapper (after I fukin figure out how)

   - make a bipolar multiply testbench.
   -- add support for bi-polar in dot_product testbench
   
   - make an alahgi adder testbench. 
   
   - make an alaghi adder tree that adds n inputs, where n is any natural number.

   - add support for alahgi adder

   - Is it best to have arguments be the means of specifying the modules.
     Maybe a config file is better?
