The script, sc_gen.py, generates verilog modules and testbenches. 
The top-level module it generates is a matrix multiply module in the stochastic domain.
Additional lower level modules are generated. Eventually a wrapper module will be
available for generation as well.

The following arguments can be processed by the script:
-dst <directory>
   specifies the directory in which to place the generated files.

-bs <number>
   specifies the batch size of the input matrix.
   In matrix multiply of MxN * NxO. Batch size is M.

-is <number>
   specifies the input feature size of the matrices.
   In matrix multiply of MxN * NxO. Input feature size is N.

-os <number>
   specifies the output feature size.
   In matrix multiply of MxN * NxO. Output size is O.

-p [uni|bi]
   specifies the representation type of the stochastic numbers.
   Uni-polar is [0,1].
   Bi-polar is [-1.1].

-alaghi
   specifies that alaghi adders are used instead of conventional stochastic 
   adders.


The srcs/templates directory contains a bunch of raw stochastic verilog code. For now it can be ignored.
